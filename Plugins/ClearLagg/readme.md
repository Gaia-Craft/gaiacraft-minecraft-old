# ClearLagg Plugin

- You can get the plugin <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/clearlagg.68271/">here!</a>
- Version of the last update is <b>3.2.2</b>
- There is a translation file for Turkish which translated by me.
- The language file not in plugin folder, it's plugin jar file. So you can change/add language file at jar/languages.
- You can change command parameters in language file, but i didn't prefer it. If you want, you can change.
